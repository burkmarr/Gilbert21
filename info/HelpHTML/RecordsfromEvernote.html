<p class="rvps3"><a class="rvts9" href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk" target="_blank">Gilbert 21</a><span class="rvts7"> - creating records from Evernote</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To create records from an Evernote notebook, you must first have an Evernote account. Setting up an Evernote account and using Evernote apps is dealt with in </span><a class="rvts8" href="Evernotesmartphoneapps.html">this topic</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Once you have an Evernote account and one or more Evernote notebooks containing notes on which you wish to base biological records, you export them for use in Gilbert 21. (Prior to November 2012 you could access Evernote notebooks directly from Gilbert 21 but after Evernote changed some access policies &nbsp;must first export notes from </span><a class="rvts8" href="http://evernote.com/download/">Evernote's own free desktop application</a><span class="rvts6"> before you can import them into Gilbert 21.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In your Evernote Desktop application, select one or notes from a notebook and then select the </span><span class="rvts15">File-&gt;Export</span><span class="rvts6"> function. Choose to export the notes in the ENEX format. Save the export file to a convenient location on your PC where you can import it from Gilbert 21. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Use the </span><span class="rvts15">Open files</span><span class="rvts6"> item from the Gilbert 21</span><span class="rvts15">File</span><span class="rvts6"> menu with the </span><span class="rvts15">Files of type</span><span class="rvts6"> option set to </span><span class="rvts15">Evernote export files (*.enex)</span><span class="rvts6">. Find your export file - Gilbert 21 will make candidate records from all the notes in the export file. For any Evernote note that was geo-tagged at the time it was made - e.g. those created using an Evernote smart-phone app - all the location and date information is filled in automatically.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The location information is just Gilbert 21's suggested locations based on the GPS location at which the tag was recorded and the data in its place name gazetteer. You don't have to accept any of these suggestions and you are free to edit any of the information.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="left" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem1.png"/><span class="rvts6">To complete the records, you need to indicate, for each one, what was seen. When you invoke </span><span class="rvts15">What</span><span class="rvts6"> tab of the record details form for one of these records, it will automatically play any sound file associated with it (see notes on playing AMR files below). You can replay the sound from any tab of the record details form by clicking the </span><span class="rvts15">Voice</span><span class="rvts6"> button. So you just listen to your own voice speaking what was seen and complete the form </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Your voice notes may record much more than what was seen. For example they could include extra information about the location if the animal or plant was not seen exactly where the note was made, or it may record information that can be recorded as a personal note rather that a biological record </span><span class="rvts15">per se</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When you have finished creating records, save them (e.g. by selecting the appropriate item from the </span><span class="rvts15">File</span><span class="rvts6"> menu). Note that you don't have to process all of the records at once. If you only do some of them, the next time you open the same data logger files again, any corresponding records that you have already saved to the database will be shown in full - so you can just pick up where you left off and start on the next unprocessed candidate record.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Using other types of note from Evernote</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You are not limited to creating records from Evernote notes with attached voice recordings. Gilbert 21 will open any Evernote note and use it as the basis for a candidate record, whether or not is has an audio file attached. For example you can make a geo-tagged Evernote note which has an attached photo. Gilbert will use use the photo as a media attachment (see the </span><span class="rvts15">Media</span><span class="rvts6"> tab of the </span><span class="rvts15">Record Properties</span><span class="rvts6"> form). Or you can simply create an Evernote note by typing - the title of the note will be used by Gilbert 21 to populate the </span><span class="rvts15">Common name</span><span class="rvts6"> field of the record and anything you type into the body of the note will be used by Gilbert 21 to initialise the </span><span class="rvts15">Comments</span><span class="rvts6"> field of the record.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Managing Evernotes</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Gilbert 21 does not manage your Evernote notes for you. So, for example, it wont delete or otherwise move notes from a notebook once it has made records from them. It is up to you to do this kind of Evernote housekeeping outside of Gilbert 21. Probably the most convenient way of doing this is via </span><a class="rvts8" href="http://evernote.com/download/">Evernote's own free desktop application</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Playing AMR files</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Note that Evernote smart-phone apps will probably produce sound files with an 'AMR' extension. Gilbert 21 can't play these files itself (as it does with WAV files) and so must rely on a third-party application to play them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To find out which application, on your computer, is the default one for playing AMR files, use Windows Explorer to locate an AMR file (e.g. in the Evernote </span><span class="rvts15">Download file folder</span><span class="rvts6"> indicated by your options) and then double-click the AMR file. If you have a default application capable of playing Evernote AMR files, it will start and play the file at this point.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you haven't you will need to get one. RealPlayer and Apple Quicktime can both play AMR files. Out of these two, RealPlayer seems to give the best results. To use either, you must install it on your computer and make sure that it is the default application for playing AMR files (as described above). However, you may be better results with the Ffplay application as described below.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Ffplay is a command line application that Gilbert 21 can use to play AMR files. You can </span><a class="rvts8" href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/Downloads.aspx">download the 'ffplay.exe' application</a><span class="rvts6"> from the Gilbert 21 website. (Make sure you get the right version for your computer - 32 or 64 bit. If you are unsure what your computer is, check the System settings in the Control Panel - it will tell you there if you computer is 64 bit. Otherwise it's probably 32 bit.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To use Ffplay, first download and then unzip the application to a convenient folder on your computer. Then there are a couple of more data options on Gilbert 21's options dialog that you need to look at:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts17">Ffplay executable</span><span class="rvts6">: you must set this to the full pathname of your 'ffplay.exe' file wherever you put it (use the browse button to find it).</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts17">Ffplay delay</span><span class="rvts6">: you can just leave this as it is. It sets a delay (in milliseconds) between ffplay being invoked at the Record Properties window being set as the 'front window'. This is really just a technical workaround so that the ffplay window doesn't obscure the Record Properties window. If ffplay seems to start but you hear no sound, you can try increasing the value of this option.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
