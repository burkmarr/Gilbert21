     <div class="page-header">What's new?</div>
        <p>This is a log of the changes that have taken place with each release of Gilbert 21.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.4.0.0, 29<span class="style1">th</span> January 2019</div>
        <p>Added an iNaturalist format option to the export functionality. This will export into 
            a CSV file with header names matching those described 
            here: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/import#csv_import">
            https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/import#csv_import</a>.</p>

        <p>There is also a new export for RODIS - "RODIS Excel" - which outputs into Excel 97-2003 format (.xls),
            rather than CSV, and has
            minor changes to header names.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.3.0.0, 30<span class="style1">th</span> July 2017</div>
        <p>Added an iRecord format option to the export functionality. This will export into 
            a CSV file with header names matching the defaults template downloadable from 
            here: <a href="https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/import-records">
            https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/import-records</a>. There is one exception - the 
            comment column header has been changed from 'Sample comment' to 'Occurrence 
            comment' since the comment in G21 pertains to each individual record rather than 
            a sample.</p>
        <p>The G21 fields 'Location' and 'Town' are joined (separated by a comma) under the 
            iRecord 'Site name' import column. Similarly the G21 'Abundance' and 'Units' 
            fields are joined (separated by a space) under the iRecord 'Quantity' column.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.2.1.0, 29<span class="style1">th</span> May 2017</div>
        <p>Fixed an issue (<a href="https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21/issues/2">https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21/issues/2</a>) 
            with the incorrect reading of geolocations from photographs when longitude 
            greater than zero degrees but less than one degree (east of Greenwich Meridian).</p>
        <p>Fixed an issue with incorrect handling of taxonomy retrieved from the NBN Atlas 
            where some taxonomic ranks had no value (<a href="https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21/issues/1">https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21/issues/1</a>), 
            causing some search results not to appear. Also improved the display of search 
            results by separating 'exact' from 'fuzzy' matches and making sure matching list 
            always scrolled to top when first presented to user. Also enabled users to 
            select higher level taxa and populate scientific name field from this.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.2.0.0, 9<span class="style1">th</span> Apr 2017</div>
        <p>Update to migrate the taxonomy search from the old NBN Gateway taxomony web 
            service to the new web service provided by the NBN Atlas.</p>
        <p>The NBN Atlas does not support the old taxonomy groupings used by the NBN Gateway 
            and utilised by G21 for grouping taxa. So if you are adding a new taxon to your 
            local dictionary by searching the NBN Atlas taxonomy, you will now need to 
            assign the taxon group manually - either selecting from the drop-down list of 
            taxon groups that you've already used, or typing a new one yourself.</p>
        <p>The ability to view a distribution map from the old Gateway WMS has been 
            disabled.</p>
        <p>Gilbert 21 is now open source. The GitHub repository is here:
            <a href="https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21">
            https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21</a></p>

        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.1.0.4, 2<span class="style1">nd</span> Jul 2015</div>
        <p>Bug fix to cope with variations in Visiontac CSV file format.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.1.0.3, 3<span class="style1">rd</span> Apr 2015</div>
        <p>Bug fix. Gilbert 21 desktop had a bug that meant when opening files from the 
        G21 Android App, it confused unique date/time stamp and associated some files
        with existing records. The bug would only have been evident if you used one of the
        new filename formats (Simple OSGR or Simple Lat Long).</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.1.0.2, 22<span class="style1">nd</span> Jan 2015</div>
        <p>Bug fix. Minimising form sent G21 to system tray even when 'Watch' option not checked. This
        release addresses that bug.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.1.0.1, 22<span class="style1">nd</span> Jan 2015</div>
        <p>Bug fix. When the NBN Rest Taxon Dictionary was used to select a dictionary entry with no common name
        (e.g. <i>Sternus vulgaris</i> or <i>Larus argentatus</i>) G21 set both common name <b>and</b> scientific name to a blank value.
        This fix addresses that. Note that, for both of the examples given, the NBN taxon 
            dictionary does not associate the expected common names with the scientific 
            names (Starling and Herring Gull). This is probably because those species are 
            split into sub-species in the dictionary. You can still associate a common name 
            with such a scientific name by specifying the common name manually (it will be 
            remembered in the local taxon dictionary).</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.1.0.0, 21<span class="style1">st</span> Jan 2015</div>
        <p>New release whose main purpose is to update Gilbert 21 to use the new <b>NBN 
            Rest services</b> in place of the old SOAP services which are due to be retired 
            early in 2015 (e.g. for the Taxon dictionary).&nbsp; Other major changes were 
            introduced to streamline the integration of G21 desktop with the G21 Android 
            App. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change to enable G21 to remember, from one session to the next, the 
                filetype option selected for opening files. So, for example, if 'Gilbert 21 
                sound files' files is selected, then this will be remembered until the next 
                session so that the user does not have to reset it.</li>
            <li>Added an option - a 'Watch' checkbox next to import folder location - which, when 
                checked, will cause G21 to intercept requests to quit or minimise the main form 
                and keep the application open - putting a G21 icon in the system tray. G21 then 
                checks the import folder every 30 minutes and pops up a message informing the user if there are any files waiting for processing. To quit the application when this option is selected, 
                use the new 'Exit Gilbert 21' item from the 'File' menu.</li>
            <li>Added a new option - 'Folder for processed' - which stores the location of a folder 
                into which files in the import folder - which relate to currently opened records 
                - can be automatically moved using a new tool button on the main form. 
                Optionally, if the 'Delete' checkbox next to this folder optio is checked, 
                such files are deleted rather than moved when the tool button is pressed. These 
                options allow users to manage imported files without resorting to external 
                tools such as Windows Explorer.</li>
            <li>G21 Desktop can now handle files generated by the new Android App - whatever 
                filename format is chosen on that device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Several minor enhancements were introduced and problems addressed in response to 
            user feedback. These included the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Occasionally Visiontac/Columbus devices can produce corrupt rows in the CSV 
                files they generate. This used to cause G21 to fall over on import, but now 
                these errors are handled more gracefully.</li>
            <li>Phenology graphs were falling over when they came across records with bad dates 
                (which can be introduced into the database when importing records without using 
                the core G21 tools).</li>
            <li>When KML files (for Google Earth) were produced containing records with 
                ampersands in the common name (e.g. 'Heart &amp; Dart') the KML files produced were 
                invalid. Now ampersands have been 'escaped' in the KML files produced so that 
                they are valid.</li>
            <li>The option to removed sounds from records has been expanded so that now more 
                than one record at a time can be handled.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Android G21 app version 1, 24<span class="style1">th</span> Jan 2015</div>
        <p>Released first version of <a href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/G21App.aspx">G21 app for Android</a>. 
        It is available as a download via this website and is not 
        yet released via the App Store.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.9, 10<span class="style1">th</span> Nov 2014</div>
        <p>Implemented a small change to cope with a change in the Evernote export format between
        Evernote 4.x and 5.x.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.8, 10<span class="style1">th</span> Apr 2013</div>
        <p>Implemented some minor enhancements: field visibility options are now remembered between
        sessions; polygon filter files can now be KML files exported from Google Earth. (The 
            KML file must contain a single polygon.)</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.7, 28<span class="style1">th</span> Mar 2013</div>
        <p>Added new export format - BirdTrack Casual - to enable export into format suitable for
        bulk upload into BTO's BirdTrack. Updated the online help to document this new 
            feature.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.6, 18<span class="style1">th</span> Mar 2013</div>
        <p>Bug fix to overcome problems experienced by new users before a database is set up. Gilbert 21 now handles
        this situation better and gives better guidance on where to find help to set everything up.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.5, 12<span class="style1">th</span> Mar 2013</div>
        <p>Added phenology graphing capability. This new feature takes advantages of graphing capabilities
        of the .NET framework version 4. Read more about it here: <a href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/HelpHTML/Gilbert%2021.html">
        http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/HelpHTML/Gilbert 21.html</a>.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.4, 23<span class="style1">rd</span> Feb 2013</div>
        <p>Fixes to bugs on export functionality. Adds capability to append to existing 
            exports of type 'None'. Improved features for KML output files for Google Earth 
            export and Google Earth quick view, including optional 'atlas' style distribution layers for exported records.
        </p>
                    
        <div class="sub-header">Version 3.0.0.3, 17<span class="style1">th</span> Feb 2013</div>
        <p>Introduces a new suite of functionality to track exports and export recipients and to
        keep an export history for each individual record. Also migrated from version 3.5 of 
            the .NET framework to version 4.0. Gilber 21 itself has moved to version 3. This 
            will not upgrade automatically from version 2. To install version 3, you must 
            install it from <a href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/version3/publish.htm">
            http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/version3/publish.htm</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Adds new record open functionality to select records based on their export history
        and who they have been sent to. This complements the new export history functionality.
        In addition, the different methods of opening (selecting) records have been integrated
        into a single dialog where the four methods can be used in conjunction.</p>
        
        <p>Added a new tool-button to remove records from the records displayed on the main
        form without removing them from the database. This helps with preparing records for 
        export.</p>
        
        <p>Removed the option from the record properties dialog to omit record checking for a
        record and, at the same time, made it possible to save 'invalid' records to the database.
        Added functionality to the options dialog to make the colours of records displayed on the
        main form user-selectable. Also changed the way that records marked to be excluded from
        exports are coloured on the main form. Instead of changing the record colour, these
        records are now highlighted by changing the colour of the record header column (the column
        where the records are sequentially numbered) on the main form.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.52, 28<span class="style1">th</span> Dec 2012</div>
        <p>Added a new ability to import Evernote ENEX export files. This overcomes a problem 
        introduced in November 2012 when Gilbert 21's direct connection to Evernote notebooks 
            stopped working due to a change in security policies introduced by Evernote.</p>
        <p>Added a new option on record details form to map associated track of currently selected
        record.</p>
        <p>Added a new option on record details form to map the locations of other records currently open
        on main form.</p>
        <p>Changed default handling of Visiontac/Columbus files so that  
        candidate records are only generated from voice tags. This can be changed 
        to make candidate records from all tags - the previous behaviour - by setting an
        option on the options form.</p>
        <p>The current database folder is now displayed on main form so you can be sure what database
        you are updating if you have more than one.</p>
        <p>During the importing of multiple files, the name of the currently importing file is
        now displayed to the right of the progress bar.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.51, 17<span class="style1">th</span> Oct 2012</div>
        <p>Accounted for bug whereby totally empty CSV files - which are sometimes producted
        by Visiontac/Columbus for some reason - caused a crash.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.50, 4<span class="style1">th</span> Oct 2012</div>
        <p>
            No longer any need to rename non-Visiontac/Columbus CSV import files so that they have
            a different file extension to '.CSV' (e.g. '.txt'). They can now be left as CSV files -
            Gilbert 21 will recognise that they are not Visiontac/Columbus files. No longer 
            need to rename import fields called 'Date' and 'Time' to 'RecDate' and 'RecTime' 
            respectively - Gilbert 21 will treat fields called either 'Date' or 'RecDate' as 
            a field containing the date and fields called either 'Time' or 'RecTime' as a 
            field containing the time.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.49, 3<span class="style1">rd</span> Oct 2012</div>
        <p>
            Upgraded NBN taxon search to use version 3.5 of the NBN Gateway web services
            (was version 3.1).</p>
        <p>
            Added tool-tips to NBN species distribution map dialog.</p>
        <p>
            Fixed bug that caused unsaved edits to be lost even when user asked for them to be saved.</p>
        <p>
            Modified code so that Gilbert 21 does not crash when opening a Visiontac/Columbus file
            for which the association sound (WAV) files cannot be located.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.48, 27<span class="style1">th</span> Sept 2012</div>
        <p>
            Added facility to view NBN species distribution maps over the Bing/Google maps 
            displayed on <i>Where</i> tab of Record Properties form (see
            <a href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/helpHTML/NBNMapping.html">NBN Mapping</a>).</p>
            
        <p>
            Updated documentation for the <i>Where</i> tab of the Record Properties form.</p>
          
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.47, 4<span class="style1">th</span> Sept 2012</div>
        <p>
            Put error traps into code to deal with instances where Gilbert 21 can't open
            an external program (e.g. a browser or Google Earth) for some reason.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.46, 3<span class="style1">rd</span> Sept 2012</div>
        <p>
            Added stdole.dll to the distribution to overcome a reported installation problem.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.45, 19<span class="style1">th</span> July 2012</div>
        <p>
            Added option to export records in the format required for importing into the
            RODIS on-line recording program. The export function outputs a CSV file which you 
            must open in Excel and save as an Excel workbook (*.xls file extension)
            before it can be imported to RODIS.</p>

        <p>
            Fixed a bug with the polygon selection function of previous versions. This bug
            could cause records outside the selection polygon to be incorrectly selected or, in
            some cases, caused some records within the selection polygon not to be selected.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.43, 4<span class="style1">th</span> June 2012</div>
        <p>
            There was a bug with the previous installation file (due to a problem with the Microsoft
            ClickOnce installation builder) which meant that it didn't build properly and
            would not install Gilbert 21 on some machines (noticed first with Vista OS). This
            new build was produced to correct that problem.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.42, 9<span class="style1">th</span> May 2012</div>
        <p>
            Introduced a new internet-based help system built with HelpNDoc. Using this tool
            a professional help system can be implemented which supports keywords, text searching
            and all the usual features. The contents of the help system can now be more easily 
            systematically compiled and added to. The new help system can be reached through 
            the Help menue from Gilbert 21 itself or from the Help link at the top of the 
            website pages.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.41, 2<span class="style1">nd</span> May 2012</div>
        <p>
            Improved the way Gilbert uses 'ffplay.exe' for playing AMR audio files from Evernote
            mobile phone apps.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.40, 30<span class="style1">th</span> April 2012</div>
        <p>
            Added an option for Evernote users to use ffplay.exe to play their AMR sound files
            from Evernote if they wish. This is useful for users who are having trouble playing
            AMR files in other ways. To use the facilty, <a href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk/Downloads.aspx">download 
            the relevant ffplay.zip file</a>,
            unzip to a convenient location on your computer and then set the 'Ffplay executable'
            option on the 'Data options' tab of the options dialog to the full path of this
            file.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.40, 30<span class="style1">th</span> April 2012</div>
        <p>
            Added a facility for searching the OS 1:50,000 gazetteer for a place name from the
            Where tab of the record properties dialog. This is useful if you are entering records
            without any GPS grid reference. You can search for a location in roughly the right
            place then use a bing or google map to locate the exact grid reference.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.38, 23<span class="style1">rd</span> April 2012</div>
        <p>
            Improved the panning behaviour for Bing and Google maps.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.35, 22<span class="style1">nd</span> April 2012</div>
        <p>
            <img src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - what&#39;s new__files/EvernoteApp.gif" style="float:right">Added ability to use Evernote notes to create records. This means that Smart phones
            can now be used to make records. To do this you need to install the Evernote app which
            is free for iPhone, Blackberry and Android. You can then use your phone
            to make notes from
            a voice recording (in a similar way to the Visiontac data logger), from a photograph or 
            from a simple written note. The phone's
            GPS is used to geotag the Evernote note and Gilbert 21 can derive the grid 
            reference from this.</p>
        <p>
            To use the feature, install the Evernote app on your phone and set up a free 
            Evernote account; then set your Evernote credentials on the options dialog. When 
            you have made some notes on your phone and synched them to your Evernote 
            account, you can select 'Open Evernote notebook' from the file menu in Gilbert 
            21 and open your notes to make records. The feaure will be 
            properly documented soon.</p>
            
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.35, 22<span class="style1">nd</span> April 2012</div>
        <p>
            <img src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - what&#39;s new__files/G21-where-tab.jpg" style="float:right">
            Added new mapping features on the 'Where' tab of the record details form. You can
            now map a record directly on the Where tab  using Bing Maps or Google Maps. 
            This is more convenient than using the Google Earth link. The best feature of 
            this is that you can click a point on a Bing or Google map and elect to use the 
            grid reference at the selected point for your record. So now you can really 
            quickly make fine adjustments to the grid references you collect in the field 
            where necessary.</p>
        <p>
            Note that Google maps and Bing maps may be subject
            to certain usage limitations - for example you can only generate 1000 different Google map
            images in the space of 24 hours (the limitations on Bing, if any, are less 
            clear). Since a new image is generated every time you pan or zoom
            or otherwise change the image, you could bump up against this limit if you are using the 
            software a lot over the course of a day.             </p>
        <p>
            Note also that this new mapping facility and associated grid reference selection supersedes the
            'calculate offset grid reference' (added 26th February) which is therefore removed.

        <p>
            The taxon group field on the record details dialog is now editable - previously 
            it was read-only. It now consists of a combo-box with all previously used taxon 
            groups appearing in the drop-down list. The taxon group can be changed/set by 
            selecting from the drop-down list or by typing in any value. (Note that new 
            values typed in here will only appear in the drop-down list after one or more 
            records with the new value have been saved to the database.)</p>

        <p>
            Changed behaviour when enter key pressed in personal notes field of record 
            details dialog. Doing this now changes focus to dialog okay button. Line breaks 
            can still be entered in the personal notes field (and now in the comments field 
            too) by holding down the [ctrl] key whilst hitting the enter key</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.34, 25<span class="style1">th</span> March 2012</div>

            Fixed bug that sometimes caused a crash when grid reference precision reset on 
            'where' tab of record details dialog.

        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.34, 25<span class="style1">th</span> March 2012</div>
        <p>
            Fixed bug that sometimes caused strange behaviour - including setting 
            incorrect values for scientific and/or common names when either of these fields 
            was meant to be blank.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.33, 14<span class="style1">th</span> March 2012</div>
        <p>
        Removed the 'Open by polygon' item from file menu and added this functionality as 
            an additional filter on the 'Open by filter' dialog. This allows filters and 
            geographic selections to be used together - for example to select all birds within a given geographic boundary.
        </p>
        
         <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.30, 27<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added new page to the website with boundary file resources for download. These files
        can be used with the 'Open records by polygon' feature.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.27, 26<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added new facility to calculate an offset grid reference from the GR recorded
        by the GPS without recourse to Google Earth. This can be used from the
        new 'Offset GR' button on the 'Where' table of the record properties dialog. This 
            can dramatically speed up record processing when offsets are regularly used.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.1.0.27, 26<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added a facility to enable new records to be initialised from a comma separated values (CSV) file
        with any of the following fields (which must be specified on the first row):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Recorder</li>
        <li>Determiner</li>
        <li>Confirmer</li>
        <li>ScientificName</li>
        <li>CommonName</li>
        <li>TaxonGroup</li>
        <li>Abundance</li>
        <li>Units</li>
        <li>GridRef</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Town</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Comment</li>
        <li>PersonalNotes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all of these fields needs to be included - none are compulsory. Extra fields with
        unrecognised names will be ignored. This facility effectively provides a record
        import capability for Gilbert 21.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added extra facilities for users to select records from the database. There
        is now a simple 'select by filter' option to quickly select records for certain
        species, taxonomic groups, date ranges etc. There is also a quick 'view all'
        facility. There is also a new facility to allow users to select
        records by polygon (e.g. LRC or vice-county area). 
        Polygons are defined in text files with each vertice described by an 
        easting northing pair on one line (separated by a space).
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added a facility to allow user to easily update gazetteer database with files
        downloaded from website - allowing detailed local place-names to be used for
        any area in Britain. (Gazetteer files derived from OS District VectorMap.)
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Updated the way timezone corrections are made to GPS times (UTC times). 
        The is handled much more inteligently by the sofware now and user is
        not required to intervene so often.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Added the facility to mark individual records as being 'not for export' so that
        they are, by default, excluded from any exports.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        The 'personal record only' checkbox has been replaced by a more general
        'do not apply record checks' checkbox. Records marked with this flag are
        now coloured blue in the record browser.

        <p>
        Introduced single tabbed dialog for record details.
        Record details entry forms - which used to be multiple - are now in a single 
        tabbed dialog. This allows more efficient record entry and also allows 
        easier access to some functions - like changing GRs from 8 to 6 figure - from anywhere.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Image handling. Added facility for linking records with images. 
        Images can optionally be stored in the DB
        or as separate linked files. Images can be annotated. In addition,
        records can be created directly from image files. If the image files are
        tagged with location (EXIF), information, this is used to derive a grid reference
        and location name. EXIF dates are also used to date the record.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Retain links between records and original track files. Previously, this link was
        lost once a recod was entered.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Re-work WAV file handling. WAV files are now stored within a database file rather than
        separately.
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>
        <p>
        Made compatible for 64 bit Windows. The programme is now specifically compiled to target
        Windows 32 bit which, ironically, allows it to run on Windows 64 bit too!
        </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Version 2.0.0.20, 24<span class="style1">th</span> February 2012</div>

        Moved from Access to SQLite DB. This was done largely in the interests of future-proofing
        (the future of Access is uncertain).

        'What's new' feature added. User is offered the chance to view the 'What's new' section
        of the website if the version of their Gilbert 21 software is newer than the last one
        they used.
