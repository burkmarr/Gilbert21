        <div class="page-header">Why Gilbert 21?</div>
        <p>The name 'Gilbert 21' is an homage to Gilbert White, the 18th century English naturalist and author
        of <i>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</i>. The '21' is, of course, a reference to the 21st century.
        </p>
        <div class="ImageRight">
                 <img alt="Gilbert White" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - the name_files/GilbertWhiteNotAuthentic.jpg">
                 <br>Gilbert White was a bit camera shy
                 <br>(easel shy?). This one is not now
                 <br>thought to be authentic!
                 </div>
        <p>In his day Gilbert White was revolutionary. Although the roots of the study of 
        natural history reach back beyond Gilbert White, it was he who virtually 
        single-handedly popularised it as a subject worthy of study in its own right. Any 
            naturalist who reads the Natural History of Selborne today - over 220 years 
            after its publication - will recognise White's spirit of enquiry and respect for 
            the natural world as the very same values that drive us to study natural history 
            today. </p>
            
        <p>Gilbert White was an ordained 
            clergyman and, for a great part of his professional life, the curate of Selborne 
            (the very village where he was born).&nbsp; He was a true 'expert amateur naturalist' and it is probably no coincidence that, to this day, the ephithet of 
            'amateur' is not seen as a barrier to achieving great expertise and respect as a 
            naturalist. I always think of natural history as one of the most egalitarian 
            intelectual pursuits there is and I believe that this is, in part, a legacy of 
            Gilbert White.</p>
            
                       <div class="ImageLeft">
                 <img alt="Morgana&#39;s Gilbert" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - the name_files/MorganaGilbert.jpg">
                 <br>Not to be confused with...
                 <br>Morgana Robinson's loveable and
                 <br>somewhat eccentric comedy creation
                 <br>Gilbert (though he bears a passing
                 <br>resemblance to one or two biological
                 <br>recorders I've met!)
                 </div>
                 
        <p>One of Gilbert White's most interesting characteristics was his interest in the 
            minutiae of the natural world. No detail of phenology, ecology, meteorology, 
            physiology, behaviour or anything else was too small to interest him and he valued <i>personal observation</i> 
            above all other means of learning about these things. 
            </p>
          <p>Over the last 30 years 
            advances in computing and communications technology have made it easier than 
            ever to combine records from thousands of naturalists into large central 
            repositories of data. 
          This has many advantages, for example in helping us to 
            formulate national conservation strategy and in making more informed decision 
            around development control. But sometimes I think that it threatens to make the pursuit 
            of natural history - which we sometimes now call 'biological recording' - a 
            little one dimensional. This is characterised by what ocasionally appears to be an 
            obsession with the 'distribution atlas'! Don't get me 
            wrong - I like a nice distribution atlas; indeed I'm involved in the production 
            of a number of them. But they're not the be-all and end-all of studying natural
            history. What about learning about, and taking joy from,
            the minutiae of every-day plants and animals through direct personal observation as Gilbert White did? </p>

        <p>The Natural History of Selborne has not been out of print since it was first 
            published. It is now recognised not only as the first classic work of the nature 
            writing genre, but simply as a classic of English literature. The book, and 
            something of Gilbert White's spirit, have influenced our culture far beyond the 
            limited world of natural historians and it is credited with inbuing our national 
            psyche with a deep respect for nature and the English landscape.</p>
        <p>But there is another sadder truth that cannot escape anyone - even the 
            non-naturalist - who reads the Natural History of Selborne today: it is that we 
            are losing so much so quickly. Just a little over 200 years ago, Gilbert White 
            was describing (often for the first time) many animals and plants that were 
            commonplace then but which are fast disappearing from our coutryside now. Post 
            war urbanisation and, particuarly, agricultural intensification has squeezed 
            much of our wildlife and the wild places on which they depend out of our 
            little island.</p>
        <p>So what will the 21st century bring? One thing it will bring, you can be sure, 
            are even more advances in technology. We should capitalise on these, where we 
            can, to enhance our appreciation of the wonder and beauty of nature and improve 
            the effectiveness with which we record our observations. That is what this 
            project is about and how it came to be called 'The Gilbert 21 Project'.</p>
