        Note that the Visiontac VGPS-900 data logger has also been marketed as the Columbus V-900.<br>
        <br>
        In general, this device has proved to be really easy to look after and use in 
        the field. It comes with a cable that enables you to charge it from a USB slot. 
        It also comes with a converter that lets you to charge it from a standard car 
        power socket. I nearly always charge mine by plugging it into a USB port on my 
        computer when I am at work. On a full charge, the battery will run for something 
        like a day, but I've never done any tests.<br>
        <br>

        Using it in the field is easy. I generally switch mine on when I leave the house 
        and when I want to make a record I take it from my pocket:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>press the voice button;</li>
        <li>wait a second until I hear a beep;</li>
        <li>say whatever I want to say; and</li>
        <li>release the button.</li>
        </ul>
        That's it - a record is in the making!
        When I am out I often make records without breaking my stride, yet alone 
        stopping, and there's no more fumbling with notebook, maps, GPS or apps.<br>
        <br>
        I usually keep my Visiontac in my pocket in a protective soft cover that comes 
        with it. The device is really tiny - dwarfed by my mobile phone - and keeping 
        both the device and my phone in the same pocket of my jeans is no problem (the 
        Visiontac's case protecting both phone and data logger). When 
        I drive, I often keep the device on a lanyard around my neck. Then when I see a 
        buzzard - or something else I want to record - I find the voice button by touch (easy 
        once you've done it a few times), move the device close to my mouth and record 
        what I've seen. A friend of mine who was a traffic policeman for many years 
        has assured me that this is legal - unlike using a mobile phone - because I am 
        not engaged in a two-way conversation. It's no more dangerous than 
        changing radio stations.<br>
        <br>
        I have had one or two minor problems with the device which are worth reporting, 
        if for no other reason than it might save someone else some time and pain learning 
        about them.<br>
        <br>
        <img id="Image2" class="ImageLeft" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - Visiontac VGPS-900_files/MicroSDCard250.jpg" style="border-width:0px;">
        Firstly I have noticed that ocassionally the voice tag I make is clipped or 
        otherwise attenuated. Sometimes this is bad enough that I can't make out what I 
        recorded and so lose the record. For me, this probably happens around 1 time in 
        100. This may be to do with the quality of the micro-SD I bought - cheaper 
        quality ones don't handle the throughput of data so well and recording sound 
        obviously generates a fair amount of data - and friends who also use the device 
        have not had the problem. You don't need a huge micro-SD card - with my 2GB card&nbsp; I could probably record 
        for a whole year on that without taking stuff off. Go for quality over size.<br>
        <br>
        Secondly if you make a voice 
        tag and then create another one immediately afterwards, the new voice tag 
        completely replaces the one you've just made. So for example if I made a tag 
        like this 'Two Gatekeepers' and then immediately made another tag like this 
        'Both males', then I would lose the first and all I would have when I tried to 
        make the record was 'Both males'. Not much use. I learned this the hard way. I 
        then did some experimenting and found that it appears to occur when the gap 
        between recording is less than about 5 seconds and you haven't moved. Generally 
        if you've waited more than about five seconds or moved more than about 5 metres, 
        you will get both voice tags. So if you need to amend something you've said 
        immediately, then either wait, move or replace the whole thing (e.g. in my 
        example, my second tag should have been 'Correction two Gatekeepers both male'). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Visiontac really made this device for hikers etc who would want to add the 
        ocasssional voice tag e.g. 'I'm at the top of Ben Nevis!'. By using it for 
        biological recording, we are really pushing the feature to its limits so its not 
        surprising that there are one or two minor glitches.</div>
