<p class="rvps3"><a class="rvts9" href="http://www.gilbert21.org.uk" target="_blank">Gilbert 21</a><span class="rvts7"> Quick-start Guide</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The following steps should enable you to get up and running quickly with Gilbert 21.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Install the software and database</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">First of all, download and install the software (from the </span><a class="rvts14" href="The Gilbert 21 Project - downloads.html">downloads</a><span class="rvts6"> page). Follow the prompts to install the software. Once the software is installed, it will start automatically and you will see the form shown below. Before you can use it, you need to set up some options.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem14.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps6"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/DesktopIcon.jpg"/><span class="rvts6">(When you next want to start Gilbert 21, you can do it from the Gilbert 21 icon, like the one shown on the right, which be on on your desktop. There is also a Windows start menu item for the Gilbert 21 project.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Set the Gilbert 21 options</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Invoke the options form by clicking on the </span><span class="rvts15">Options</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button (red toolbox icon).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem15.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The options you need to deal with at this stage are all at the top of this form. Most importantly you need to provide values for </span><span class="rvts15">Default recorder</span><span class="rvts6">, </span><span class="rvts15">Default determiner </span><span class="rvts6">(both will be your name) and </span><span class="rvts15">Database folder</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/G21-options-form-values.jpg"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem16.png"/><span class="rvts6">The database folder should be a folder you have created especially to store your database files. This could be a folder called something like </span><span class="rvts15">Gilbert 21</span><span class="rvts6"> in your </span><span class="rvts15">My Documents</span><span class="rvts6"> folder. (You don't need a value for </span><span class="rvts15">V1 database</span><span class="rvts6"> - that is just for converting databases from previous versions.) </span><span class="rvts15">Default import folder</span><span class="rvts6"> and </span><span class="rvts15">Default export folder</span><span class="rvts6"> just tell Gilbert 21 where to look first when opening files from the GPS and saving exported files respectively. You can set these as you see fit. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">It's a good idea to set a specific folder for storing Visiontac / Columbus files since you may create a large number of them. It is normally most convenient to create a new sub-folder (within this main folder) in which to store the files every time you copy them from your device.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Now close the options form.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Creating a new database</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem17.png"/><span class="rvts6">You are ready to create a new Gilbert 21 database in the folder you specified on the options dialog. Go to the </span><span class="rvts15">Tools</span><span class="rvts6"> menu and select the </span><span class="rvts15">Create empty database</span><span class="rvts6"> item.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Once you've done that, you could start using Gilbert 21, but it is best to download some place-name (gazetteer) files first so that Gilbert 21 can help you match grid references to place names. To do that go to the </span><a class="rvts14" href="The Gilbert 21 Project - gazfiles.html">Gazetteer Files</a><span class="rvts6"> page and click on the </span><span class="rvts15">os50gaz.zip</span><span class="rvts6"> link to download that zip file to your computer. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">At the same time, download one or two of the other more detailed gazetteer files corresponding to the geographical areas where you do your recording. Unzip these files on your computer to some convenient temporary location and then use the </span><span class="rvts15">Load gazetteer file</span><span class="rvts6"> menu item from the </span><span class="rvts15">Tools</span><span class="rvts6"> menu to select and load them into Gilbert's gazetteer database. Once this is done, you can delete these files (and the zip files).</span></p>
<p class="rvps7"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem18.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Enter a record from your notebook</span></p>
<p class="rvps7"><span class="rvts6">This is how you can enter a record for which you already know the grid reference, date etc - e.g. records which you have in a notebook.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">First click on the </span><span class="rvts15">New record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button which looks like a little yellow star. This will create a new blank record. You will notice that the name of the recorder is already filled in with the default name that you supplied when you set up the options.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem19.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In Gilbert's main form, click on the empty cell for your new record under either </span><span class="rvts15">CommonName</span><span class="rvts6"> or </span><span class="rvts15">ScientificName</span><span class="rvts6">. The record details form will appear where all these things can be specified.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Click in the </span><span class="rvts15">Common name</span><span class="rvts6"> field and type the common name for the species you want to record - in this example it is </span><span class="rvts15">Buzzard</span><span class="rvts6">. Now click the </span><span class="rvts15">Search</span><span class="rvts6"> button to search the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) taxon dictionary web service for this name.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem20.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The NBN taxon dictionary web service will return the results shown above. By expanding the the item </span><span class="rvts15">Buteo buteo</span><span class="rvts6"> and clicking on the </span><span class="rvts15">Buzzard</span><span class="rvts6"> item which appears below it, you will populate the rest of the form with the required values.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Now we want to enter location information. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You can either use your keyboard's </span><span class="rvts15">Tab</span><span class="rvts6"> key from the record details form to navigate to the </span><span class="rvts15">Where</span><span class="rvts6"> tab or just click the tab. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem22.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">(From the main form, you can click the mouse on any field associated with the location to invoke the record details form with the </span><span class="rvts15">Where</span><span class="rvts6"> tab selected.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Assuming that, in this instance, you know the grid reference that you want to enter, type it into the </span><span class="rvts15">Grid Ref</span><span class="rvts6"> box and click the </span><span class="rvts15">Get location from grid ref</span><span class="rvts6"> button.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts15">Get location</span><span class="rvts6"> function compares the grid reference you entered to the gazetteer of geo-referenced location and town names that you built previously and lists the nearest ones. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The very nearest town and location are offered as default values. You can accept these, pick any others from the list, or simply type in your own.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You can see a map of the location specified by the grid reference by clicking the </span><span class="rvts15">Map</span><span class="rvts6"> button. You can use the map options radio buttons to switch between Bing and Google Maps (or optionally linking to Google Earth). Use the controls on the map to change between they types of mapping provided by each supplier and to change the zoom level (with the slider control). You can also pan the map by dragging it with the mouse. If you click the mouse anywhere on the map, the grid reference of the location where you clicked is put into the box at the top of the map. You can use this new grid reference as the location for your record, by clicking the </span><span class="rvts15">Use</span><span class="rvts6"> button.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Now we want to enter date information. Again you can use your keyboard's </span><span class="rvts15">Tab</span><span class="rvts6"> key from the record details form to navigate to the </span><span class="rvts15">When</span><span class="rvts6"> tab or just click on it. (From the main form, you can click the mouse on the date field to invoke the record details form with the </span><span class="rvts15">When</span><span class="rvts6"> tab selected.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To set a date you must un-check the </span><span class="rvts15">No date</span><span class="rvts6"> checkbox. Today's date is presented by default, but you can click on the calendar icon to invoke a date selection control to change that.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem23.png"/><span class="rvts6">You can navigate to the </span><span class="rvts15">Commentary</span><span class="rvts6"> tab of the record details form in the way you have, by now, become used to. Here you can enter a comment or a </span><span class="rvts15">Personal note</span><span class="rvts6"> if you like. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">How you use these fields is up to you, but the general idea is that you can use the 'Comment' field to record notes that you would like to pass onto others when you export the record, whereas you can use the 'Personal notes' field to record information that is for your own use - stuff that you would not necessarily pass on with the records when you export them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">When you commit the record details form, you will notice that all the information you entered on it has be entered against the record in the main form.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Entering more records</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To enter another new record, click the </span><span class="rvts15">New record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button on the main form again and repeat the process outlined above.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem24.png"/><span class="rvts6"> </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem25.png"/><span class="rvts6">The image above shows the main form just after you've clicked the </span><span class="rvts15">New record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button again. Notice that the record previously entered is coloured orange (by default). This signifies a modified record that it has not been saved to the database.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To save the record to the database, select </span><span class="rvts15">Save records</span><span class="rvts6"> from the </span><span class="rvts15">File</span><span class="rvts6"> menu. All records will be saved to the database (unless they have are candidate records created from an input file - see below - that have not been modified). If the record is a valid biological record, the colour will change colour to green (by default).&nbsp; If it is not a valid biological record - e.g. because you haven't entered a date - it will turn grey (by default). Note that you can change all these default colours on the options dialog.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem26.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If, instead of clicking the </span><span class="rvts15">New record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button, you click the </span><span class="rvts15">Copy record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button (the one that looks like two bits of paper) when you have a record selected, something different happens. In the example below, the record of the Sparrowhawk was selected and then the </span><span class="rvts15">Copy record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button clicked.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem27.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The big difference between this and the </span><span class="rvts15">New record</span><span class="rvts6"> function is that is that the location and date information have been copied from the selected record. However the details of what was seen are not copied. (In fact you can select which fields are to be copied, and which are not, on the options form.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts15">Copy record</span><span class="rvts6"> tool-button can be useful if you want to enter more than one record for the same location and date (e.g. records from a moth trap or a quadrat).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">With the new record selected, hit the </span><span class="rvts15">Tab</span><span class="rvts6"> key on your keyboard or click the mouse in the </span><span class="rvts15">CommonName</span><span class="rvts6"> or </span><span class="rvts15">ScientificName</span><span class="rvts6"> cells of the new record. The record details form appears again. See what happens if you start to type </span><span class="rvts15">Buzzard</span><span class="rvts6"> into the </span><span class="rvts15">Common name</span><span class="rvts6"> entry box: </span><span class="rvts15">Buzzard</span><span class="rvts6"> will be suggested to you and you can just hit the </span><span class="rvts15">Enter</span><span class="rvts6"> key on your keyboard to accept it. Gilbert 21 remembers the species you have entered before and helps you to select these quickly so that you don't have to keep getting the name from the NBN Gateway. It really speeds things up.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Entering records from data logger files</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you have downloaded the sample GPS datalogger files, copy the file </span><span class="rvts15">Sample.zip</span><span class="rvts6"> to a folder on your computer, e.g. the </span><span class="rvts15">Gilbert21</span><span class="rvts6"> sub-folder of your </span><span class="rvts15">My documents</span><span class="rvts6"> folder and extract the files. Once extracted, there will be a single CSV file and a number of WAV files.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For a demonstration of how to create records from the files created by the Visiontac VGPS-900, select the </span><span class="rvts15">Open files</span><span class="rvts6"> item from the file menu and use the standard Windows </span><span class="rvts15">file open dialog</span><span class="rvts6"> to open the sample file </span><span class="rvts15">10080200.CSV</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem28.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The import of the file automatically produces, in this case, 29 candidate records. Notice how all the location and date information is filled in automatically. This is because the GPS data logger file stores, for each 'voice tag' made, the location and time at which the tag was made. Of course this location information is just Gilbert 21's suggested locations based on the GPS location at which the tag was recorded and the data in its place name gazetteer. You don't have to accept any of these suggestions and you are free to edit any of the information.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img align="right" alt="Voice button" src="lib/G21-taxon-voice-button.jpg"/><span class="rvts6">To complete the records, you need to indicate, for each one, what was seen. When you invoke </span><span class="rvts15">What</span><span class="rvts6"> tab of the record details form for one of these records, it will automatically play the sound file (WAV file) associated with it. You can replay the sound from any tab of the record details form by clicking the </span><span class="rvts15">Voice</span><span class="rvts6"> button.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">So you just listen to your own voice speaking what was seen and complete the form accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Note that voice tags may record much more than what was seen. For example it could include extra information about the location if the animal or plant was not seen exactly where the tag was made, or it may record information that can be recorded as a 'personal note' rather that a biological record </span><span class="rvts15">per se</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
