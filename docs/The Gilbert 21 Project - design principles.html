        <div class="page-header">Guiding principles</div>
        <p>A number of principles tend to guide the development of the
        Gilbert 21 project and biological recording software. 
        These are outlined here.

        <div class="sub-header"><a name="minimise-time">Minimise time spent making records</a></div>
        <p>This is perhaps the most important guiding principle; it is,
        after all, the <i>raison d'être</i> for the Gilbert 21 project. Using a voice data 
        logger in the field is the single biggest innovation to achieve this end. Using 
        this method, the time taken in the field to make a record may hardly be any 
        longer than the time taken to speak the name of the plant or animal seen. No 
        other method of making records in the field can compare to this. There are new 
        developments in mobile recording using apps running on PDAs or phones with 
        built-in GPS, but no mobile application can compare with a GPS data logger with 
            voice in 
        terms of speed and convenience in the field.</p>
        <p>The price of spending less field-time on the tedious business of making records 
        is paid when you get home by post-processing the recordings using a computer program. So the other aspect of this guiding principle is to make the 
        Gilbert 21 program - the software used to post-process information from the 
        data logger - as efficient and speedy as possible. The total time to make a 
        record using a voice data-logger and Gilbert 21 program should be no more than 
        the total time taken to make a record using a method such as a 
        mobile app. The difference is that with a mobile app, all the time taken is 
        field-time which reduces the time you spend acutally observing and enjoying 
        wildlife; whilst with a voice data logger, the larger proportion of the time is 
        taken away from the field at a time of your choosing (for example whilst your 
        partner is monopolising the television to watch Dancing on Ice or Match of the 
        Day).</p>
        <div class="sub-header"><a name="suggest">Suggest, but don't mandate</a></div>
        <p>This 
        is a key principle guiding the development of Gilbert 21. In 
        contrast to other biological recording programs which often force you to 
        choose values for some fields from restricted lists, Gilbert 21 will often allow you to put what you want.</p>
         <span class="ImageLeft"><img alt="Russula ochroleuca by Stephen Pardue" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - design principles_files/RussulaOchroleuca.gif" style="width: 200px;">
            <br><i>Russula ochroleuca</i> © <a href="http://www.wildlifeillustration.com/">Stephen Pardue</a>
        </span>
        
        <p>An obvious example of where this principle is applied is in the taxon name. Most 
        biological recording programs will insist that the names of the taxa you record 
        are selected from an internal database of valid taxa. Recorder 6 and MapMate 
        both do this, for example, and the reasons are clear:&nbsp; these programs are 
        fundamentally designed to collate biological records from 
        mutliple recorders and are often used as central data repositories for data 
        enterprises like National Recording Schemes and Local Record Centres. To allow 
        unrestricted naming of taxa in these situations would be a recipe for chaos.</p>
        <p>Gilbert 21, on the other hand, is designed for <i>personal</i> biological 
        recording (see also the principle on <a href="The Gilbert 21 Project - design principles.html#keep-it-personal">personal observations</a>). A good way 
        to think about it is as a more structured version of your field notebook. 
        If you see a plant hopper which you cannot name at the time, but which you have 
        come to know as the 'diddy blue hopper', then Gilbert 21 lets you record it as 
        such, just as you would in a notebook, because <i>it means something to you. </i>It won't mean anything to anyone else of 
        course, which is 
        why Recorder 6 or MapMate, to name but two, would reject it. But Gilbert 21 is primarily about your personal record keeping and learning. Therefore the diddy blue hopper will be treated just like any other taxa 
        until such time as you are able to put a valid name to it.</p>
        <p>Clearly though, you will normally&nbsp; want to record identified taxa with valid 
            names, so Gilbert 21 provides a facility for you to look up and use 
            valid taxonomic names, just like other biological recording software. The 
            difference is, it won't complain if you don't choose to use something it 
            suggests.</p>
        <p>This principle is also applied to other fields which are often restricted by 
            other biological recording programs, notably those fields assoicated with 
            locations and recorder's names. For example, when you enter a grid reference in 
            Gilbert 21 - either manually or from a data logger - it can suggest a 
            location name by comparing the grid reference against a database of 
            georeferenced location names. You are free to accept any of the suggestions put 
            forward by Gilbert 21 or use a name of your own making.</p>

            </span>
            <p>
                Many times in the field, naturalists want to record observations that aren't, 
                strictly speaking, biological records. For example noting something about the 
                weather or perhaps making a general comment that the birds are in particuarly 
                good voice. Whilst they sit happily alongside biological records in personal 
                notebooks, biological recording programs do not normally cater for these types 
                of observation. This is because, by their very nature, they are unstructured and 
                difficult to combine and analyse with other unstructured information from 
                multiple recorders. But reading back these kind of personal notes can be very 
                rewarding and aid the learning of the naturalist who made them. So Gilbert 21 
                provides a facility to record these types of observations - which it calls 
                'personal notes' - and these can be recalled and examined just like biological 
                records.</p>
        <p>In this respect, the personality of Gilbert 21 is different from those of other biological recording programs. I envisage that Gilbert 21 will 
                be used to manage personal records and 
                many of the software features are designed around that idea. 
                Gilbert 21 will never sport an equivalent of MapMate's synching capability. This doesn't mean that records from Gilbert 21 
                cannot be shared: on the contrary there is a very strong emphasis on <a href="The Gilbert 21 Project - design principles.html#onward-use"><i>onward</i> use 
                of records</a>. But software designed to integrate records from many 
            different users (e.g. MapMate and Recorder 6) needs a whole set of features and 
            data structures to facilitate that; features that Gilbert 21 can well do 
            without.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-header"><a name="maximise-learning">Maximise learning from observations</a></div>
            <p>Most existing biological recording programs confine themselves to large-scale 
                analyses like distribution mapping, taking advantage of the information 
                generated by combining records from&nbsp; many different users. Gilbert 21 will 
                support learning in a different way - I want the emphasis to be on extracting 
                meaning and lessons from the intimate details of personal records, in much the 
                same way as a naturalist learns something when re-reading their own notebooks 
                spanning a number of years. I would like to think, that when I have a few 
                years-worth of my own personal records in Gilbert 21, information will be 
                presented back to me in ways that will stimulate ideas about my observations. For example, when I start the program, it would be nice to see 
                what I recorded on or around the same time in the previous year and the years 
                before that; I'd like to read back the intimate details of the comments and 
                personal notes I associated with those records.</p>
 
            <div class="sub-header"><a name="onward-use">Facilitate onward use of records</a></div>
             
            <p>Although Gilbert 21 is not designed to collate observations from many different 
                users, it is designed to facilitate the export of your records so that they can 
            <span class="ImageLeft"><img alt="Crab Apple by Stephen Pardue" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - design principles_files/CrabApple.gif" style="width: 200px;">
            <br>Crab Apple © <a href="http://www.wildlifeillustration.com/">Stephen Pardue</a>
            </span>
                be collated and used in other biological recording programs. My aim is to 
                provide many facilities that ease the burden of moving records from Gilbert 21 
                into the wider records network from where they can be used to benefit 
                conservation planning and management. </p>
        <p>I want to provide facilities such as the 
                ability to export records for a given geographical area (e.g. that relating to 
                an LRC or a Vice County). I also want users of Gilbert 21 to be able to see a 
                full 'export history' for any given record so that they can recall exactly how 
                they have exported the record in the past and who have been the recipients.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-header"><a name="free-services">Leverage existing free services, data and software</a></div>
            <p>Gilbert 21 will make use of existing free services, data and software wherever 
                possible. For example Gilbert 21 makes extensive use of Google Earth, linking to 
                it to perform a number of different spatial functions. Gilbert 21 does not have 
                its own taxon dictionary; instead it makes use of the NBN Gateway taxon 
                dictionary web service, neatly circumventing the huge overhead of maintaining 
                its own. As an example of making use of free data, Gilbert 21 uses free 
                gazetteer resources from the Ordnance Survey to suggest location names for 
                records georeferenced by GPS. </p>
            
            <div class="sub-header"><a name="keep-it-simple">Keep data structures simple</a></div>
            <p>I aim to keep the data structure of records held in Gilbert 21's database flat - 
                that means a single table for all the stuff that comprises the actual 
                observations. This comes at a slight efficiency cost when compared to a properly 
                normalised structure, but the relatively simple data structure of a biological 
                record means that cost needn't be too high. An advantage is that it makes the 
                coding and maintenance of the software far simpler as well as making the 
                database more robust.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, other tables in Gilbert 21's database that aren't directly 
            part of the biological records and observations. For example there will be a 
            number of tables around the funcitonality to provide export histories for 
            records. </p>

            <div class="sub-header"><a name="not-for-profit">The project is 'not for profit'</a></div>
            <p>I have no intention of making a commercial product from Gilbert 21. But I 
                will be very happy if any of the ideas it involves are taken on board by 
                commercial biological recording software suppliers.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-header"><a name="have-fun">Remember - it's supposed to be fun!</a></div>
            <p>The main driving force behind Gilbert 21 is my own desire to make biological 
                recording as efficient as possible and to prevent it from detracting from my 
                enjoyment of nature in the field. The last thing I want to happen is to make a 
                rod for my own back with Gilbert 21. This principle is to remind me of that!</p>
        <p>One of the things I need to avoid is trying to make it do to much. Remembering 
            what Gilbert 21 is <i>not</i>, is just as important as recognising what it is.</p>
        <p>Gilbert 21 is not commercial software and therefore does not have to be bound by 
            normal software design conventions. I will not worry too much about flouting 
            these if it makes the software more efficient to use, though I will endeavour to 
            avoid making it too counter-intuitive.</p>
