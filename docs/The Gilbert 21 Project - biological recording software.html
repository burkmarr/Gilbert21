        <p style="font-size:larger"><i>The Gilbert 21 project provides free biological recording software for
        people who want to record wildlife and use their records to learn about
        natural history. Read more about the background to the project here, or go
        to the <a href="The Gilbert 21 Project - downloads.html">downloads</a> page to get the software. Read

        <p>The Gilbert 21 Project is my personal effort to deal with the tension that I 
        have felt in the field between two wishes: on the one hand to enjoy the moment 
        and, on the other, to record it.

        Stopping to extract equipment from bag or 
        pocket, take grid references and write everything down has, very often,&nbsp;
        diminished my enjoyment of natural history. So much so that on many ocassions I 
        simply haven't bothered to record what I've seen or heard. I know from 
        conversations with other naturalists that many of them feel the same.
        </p>
        <p>  
        And yet I know that taking records is one of the keys to learning about natural 
        history and the records themselves, when combined with those of other 
        naturalists, are of incalculable value in our efforts to conserve wildlife and habitats.<br>
        </p>
        <p> 
        I was talking to another naturalist about this and he mentioned that a 
        friend of his used a dictaphone instead of a notebook in the field. I thought 
        that I would do the same: I would speak my observations into a dictaphone, read 
        the grid reference from a GPS and dictate that too. Then I would play the tapes 
        back later and type it all into a spreadsheet or whatever. 
        </p>

        </span>
        <p> 
        But then I wondered 
        if there might be a dictaphone with a built in GPS that would tag the recordings 
        with their location - that way I would only have to bother with one bit of kit 
        instead of two. I did some research on the internet and I couldn't find one. 
        However, what I did find was a GPS data logger with the ability to record 
        voice tags. 
        I bought one and the Gilbert 
        21 Project was born.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Buying the device was just the first step. I needed a way to take the data from the 
        files produced
        by the data logger and convert them to valid biological records as efficiently as 
        possible. The Gilbert 21 program is my solution to that. Once I started 
        developing the software, I wanted to use it for all of my records - not just 
        those that I created with the data logger. For example, I wanted to transfer records from
        notebooks and those I collected from my moth trap into the same software. In short, I
        wanted it to fulfil all my personal record collation needs.<br>
        </p>
        <p> 
        This website documents 
        the project and software with the aim of making the latter freely available to 
        anyone that would like to give it a try and to encourage wider consideration of 
        this method of biological recording amongst naturalists and providers of 
        biological recording software.
