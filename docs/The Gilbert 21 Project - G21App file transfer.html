        <div class="page-header">Setting up automatic cloud transfer of files from App to PC</div>
        
        <p>
            This page describes one way in which automatic file transfer via cloud storage 
            can be set up between your G21 Android app and your PC. One tried and tested 
            approach is described here. Other combinations of Apps and/or cloud storage 
            providers could also work well.</p>
        <p>
            <i>Using the setup described here, I make recordings in the field using my 
            Android phone. Then later, when I am using my laptop, I get a notification from 
            Gilbert 21 (which is running in the background on my computer) to say that sound 
            files are ready for import. I open Gilbert 21 and then open the files that are ready 
            for importing. I make records from the files and when I'm done I click a button 
            on Gilbert 21 and the imported files are archived. There's no need to remove the 
            files from my phone - the cloud storage and synchronisation apps take care of 
            all that for me. I don't have to do any file management outside of Gilbert 21.</i></p>
        
         <div class="sub-header">Setup overview</div>
       
        <p>
            The steps I carried out to set up the workflow described above are summarised 
            below. For more details of these steps, see the sections below on setting up the 
            smartphone and setting up the PC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I installed Google Drive on my PC.</li>
            <li>I created a folder on my PC in the Google Drive folder called 'G21V2'.</li>
            <li>I installed the Google Drive app on my Smartphone.</li>
            <li>I installed the Autosynch Drive app on my Smartphone.</li>
            <li>I configured the Autosynch Drive app to do a '2-way synch' between the Goole 
                Drive 'G21V2' folder on my phone and the G21 app file folder 
                'Phone\Android\data\uk.org.gilbert21.app\files'.</li>
            <li>On my PC I configured Gilbert 21 so that the 'Default import folder' setting was 
                set to the path of the Google Drive 'G21V2' folder.</li>
            <li>I checked the 'Watch' option next to this setting.</li>
            <li>I set up a folder (outside of cloud storage) to store processed sound files.</li>
            <li>I set the 'Folder for processed' on the settings form to the path of this 
                folder.</li>
            <li>From the open file dialog ('File-&gt;Open files') I set the file type to 'Gilbert 
                21 App sound files'.</li>
        </ul>
             
        <div class="sub-header">Setup on the smartphone</div>
        
        <img id="Image1" class="ImageRight" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - G21App file transfer_files/g21-phone-apps.png" style="border-width:0px;width: 150px;float:right">
        <p>
            The screenshot on the right shows the shortcut for the Gilbert 21 app and, 
            immediately to the left of that, two 
            more apps that I use to implement this automatic file transfer workflow: <i>Google Drive</i> and 
            <i>Drive 
            Autosych</i>. I use the subscription-free versions of these apps/services.</p>
        <p>
            I also have Google Drive installed on my PC and in the the Google Drive folder 
            on my PC I created a folder (which I called 'G21V2') to store the sound files 
            from the G21 app. Because of the way that Google Drive works, an equivalent 
            'G21V2' storage area is automatically setup on my phone by its Google Drive app 
            once both PC and app have synchronised via the Google Drive cloud storage.</p>
        <p>
            Google Drive (like Dropbox) works differently on Android compared to the way it 
            works on a Windows PC. On Android, Google Drive does not create an actual 'G21V2' folder on the phone that the 
            G21 app could write into; the 'G21V2' folder is a virtual folder on the phone 
            and only other apps which use the Google Drive API can write to it. Drive 
            Autosynch is one such app.</p>
        <p>
            Drive Autosynch allows you to synchronise an actual folder on your phone with a 
            virtual Google Drive folder. So I have configured Drive Autosynch to do a 
            'two-way' synch between the 'G21V2' Drive folder and the actual folder on the 
            phone that the G21 app writes its sound files to (on my phone it's 
            'Phone\Android\data\uk.org.gilbert21.app\files'). </p>
        <p>
            So when the G21 app creates sound files in its app folder, they will 
            be automatically copied to the Google Drive 'G21V2' folder by Drive 
            Autosynch and, in turn, Google Drive will automatically copy them, via 'the 
            cloud', to the 'G21V2' folder on my PC. </p>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Setup on the PC</div>
        
        <p>
            Google Drive is installed on the PC and sound files 
            from the app are automatically transferred to the PC via Drive Autosynch and 
            Google Drive. On the 'General' tab of the Gilbert 21 Options dialog, there are a 
            number of options - shown below - that must be set up correctly to get the most 
            out of this workflow. </p>
            
        <img id="Image3" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - G21App file transfer_files/g21-watch-import-folder.png" style="border-width:0px;">
        <p>
            The 'Default import folder' should be set to the Google Drive folder that holds 
            the sound files transferred from the G21 app. Next to this is the 'Watch' 
            checkbox. When this is checked, Gilbert 21 does not minimise to the taskbar or 
            exit when the form minimise or close icons are used (top-right of form) - 
            instead it disappears to the Windows system tray from where it monitors the 
            default import folder. Periodically, if it finds files in that folder, it 
            informs you by popping up a message bubble (see below).</p>
            
        <img id="Image2" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - G21App file transfer_files/G21-records-waiting.png" style="border-width:0px;">
        <p>
            You can also check if there are files waiting to be processed at any time simply 
            by passing your mouse cursor over the G21 system tray icon. To open Gilbert 21, 
            just click on the system tray icon. Then use the 'File-&gt;Open files' menu item to 
            open the waiting G21 app files. The open file dialog will open initially on the 
            folder specified by your 'Default import folder' option. If you do not see your 
            files immediately, you may need to change the file type in the dialog to 
            'Gilbert 21 App sound files'. Your computer will remember this file type 
            selection for future sessions.</p>
        <p>
            I like to have my PC set up so that Gilbert 21 starts automatically when I start 
            the PC. Then, once it has started, I just use the form's exit or minimise 
            control to send Gilbert 21 to the system tray where it sits quietly monitoring 
            the default import folder. In order to start Gilbert 21 automatically when my PC 
            boots, I copied a shortcut to it into the following folder: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. 
            I think that you need admin priviledges to do that. Note that with the 'Watch' 
            option checked, you can only quit Gilbert 21 by using the 'File-&gt;Exit Gilbert 
            21' menu item.</p>
        <p>
            Once I have processed waiting sound files, then I use the 'Move/delete G21 sound 
            files' toolbutton (on the far right in the image below) to move the sound files 
            out of my default import folder ('G21V2') and into the folder specified by the 
            'Folder for processed' option (see image above). If you do not want to 
            keep the sound files, then check the 'Delete' checkbox next to the 'Folder for 
            processed' option and Gilbert 21 will just delete the sound files when you use 
            the toolbutton (after first asking you to confirm the deletion).</p>
            
        <img id="Image4" src="./The Gilbert 21 Project - G21App file transfer_files/g21-move-delete-files.png" style="border-width:0px;">
        <p>
            In due course, Google Drive notes that the files have been removed from 'G21V2' 
            and synchronises this to the cloud storage. My smartphone's Google Drive app, in 
            due course, syncrhonises with the cloud storage and removes the files from the 
            virtual 'G21V2' folder on the phone. Autosynch Drive, in due course, notes that 
            the files have been removed from 'G21V2' and, because it is set up to do a 
            '2-way synch', removes the sound files from G21 apps file storage folder. All 
            this without any intervention from me.</p>
        <p>
            Note that synching may not always happen immediately or when you expect it to. 
            There could be many reasons for this. For example cloud storage syncrhonisation 
            can be configured to work only when a wifi connection is available (as opposed 
            to a 3G connection for example). Autosynch Drive can be configured only to 
            syncrhonise when the battery level of your phone is above a certain threshold 
            (the default is 50%). So you may need to tinker with settings in these apps. 
            Remeber that both Autosynch Drive and Google Drive should allow you to 'force' a 
            syncrhonise at any given point in time. </p>
